# Evaluating-Strategies
Code for replicating figures from the paper Evaluating strategies for spatial allocation of vaccines based on risk and centrality by BJ Singer, RN Thompson, and MB Bonsall

Running the commands in bash_script.txt recreates the strategy_testing_summary*.csv files, which can be used to recreate the figures 3 and 4 from the paper by running strategy_testing_figures.py
